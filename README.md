# Diffusion Analysis of Political Parties Founded after Droughts in India
## 1. Relationship between rainfall and political parties foundings
First, I set up the relationship between rainfall and political party foundings, and then modify the rainfall measure to generate a statistically independent measure for droughts.This modification will allow us to isolate the effect of economic strain from other underlying features of a region.
* Show the visual relationship between the level of rainfall in a district in the period leading up to the current election, and the
number of political parties that are founded in a region
* Prove that the raw level of rainfall are not independent from one election period to the next within a district, as well as from neighboring districts from one election period to the next
* Create a measure that sums the number of years a district experiences either moderate droughts or floods during the interval starting from the year following the previous election up until the year of the current election
## 2. Relationship between extreme weather experiences and new political parties foundings
Next, I analyze whether there are more new political parties when droughts or floods occur, by running a regression predicting the number of new political parties that are formed as a function of the number of years a district experiences droughts or flooding in the interval starting from the year following the previous election up until the year of the current election. The results show that extreme weathers have significantly impact on the new polical parties founding. Besides,I found that farming party is more likely to be formed when a district experiences extreme weather.
## 3. Relationship between extreme weather in one district with political activity in another district.
In this part, I looked at how political activity stimulated by droughts or floods in one district might affect political activity in another district
## 4. relationship between experiencing droughts or floods and political concentration
## 5. diffusion effect
