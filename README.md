# Diffusion Analysis of Political Parties Founded after Droughts in India
## 1. Relationship between rainfall and political parties foundings
First, I set up the relationship between rainfall and political party foundings, and then modify the rainfall measure to generate a statistically independent measure for droughts.This modification will allow us to isolate the effect of economic strain from other underlying features of a region.
* Show the visual relationship between the level of rainfall in a district in the period leading up to the current election, and the
number of political parties that are founded in a region
* Prove that the raw level of rainfall are not independent from one election period to the next within a district, as well as from neighboring districts from one election period to the next
* Create a measure that sums the number of years a district experiences either moderate droughts or floods during the interval starting from the year following the previous election up until the year of the current election
## 2. Relationship between extreme weather experiences and new political parties foundings
Next, I analyze whether there are more new political parties when droughts or floods occur, by running a regression predicting the number of new political parties that are formed as a function of the number of years a district experiences droughts or flooding in the interval starting from the year following the previous election up until the year of the current election. 

The results show that extreme weathers have significantly impact on the new polical parties founding. Besides,I found that farming party is more likely to be formed when a district experiences extreme weather.
## 3. Relationship between extreme weather in one district with political activity in another district.
In this part, I looked at how political activity stimulated by droughts or floods in one district might affect political activity in another district. 

The results show that even when taking into account a district’s own droughts and floods, that district’s degree of political foundings will also depend on the number of years its neighboring districts experience years of droughts or flooding in the interval starting from the year following two elections ago, up until the year of the previous election—the election lead-up interval
before the current one.
## 4. Relationship between extreme weather and political concentration
Extreme weather events like droughts or floods can erode the stability of political systems and wear away at the entrenched power bases of large, national-scale parties that have difficulty responding to the needs of affected regions. Thus, here I wonder whether experiencing droughts or floods relate to political concentration. I performed a regression predicting the Herfindahl Index of a region as a function of the number of years of droughts or flooding that occur in a district in the interval leading up to the current election, and the number of years of droughts or flooding that occur in its neighboring districts in the interval leading up to the previous election.
